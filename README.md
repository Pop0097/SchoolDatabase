## School_Database

# What is School_Database?

This database uses a text-based UI to enable users to create, update, and destroy information pertaining to a school.

When deployed, the database creates a default school with ten teachers, fifty students, one administrator, and three courses (each with a teacher and two students). The user can then create, read, update, or delete the given information as they see fit. This database is not hosted, thus the termination of the program will result in the loss of all changes made by the user.

# Inspiration

I made this database to learn about object oriented programming in C++.

# How to deploy the program

1. Download the repository onto your computer.
2. Open the .cpp and .h files in an IDE that can compile C++ and run the code.
3. Navigate the database in the IDE and enjoy! :))

NOTE: the default sign in credentials for administrators and teachers are as follows:
- Username: d_uname
- Password: pass
